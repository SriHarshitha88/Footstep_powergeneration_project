Objective
The main objectives of this project are:

Design a renewable energy system using footstep-based power generation.
Convert kinetic energy from footsteps into electrical energy.
Store the generated energy efficiently for future use.
Monitor and regulate energy output using an Arduino-based system.
Installation
Prerequisites
Arduino IDE: Download and install the Arduino IDE.
Libraries: Install necessary libraries via the Arduino IDE (e.g., LiquidCrystal_I2C for the LCD).
Hardware Setup
Piezoelectric Sensors: These sensors convert the mechanical force of footsteps into electrical energy.
Arduino Board: Use an Arduino Uno or any compatible microcontroller to process sensor data and control the system.
Rechargeable Battery: A battery stores the energy generated by the piezoelectric sensors.
LCD Display: Displays the step count and voltage readings.
Wiring
Connect the piezoelectric sensors to the Arduino inputs for monitoring.
The battery connects to the Arduino for power supply.
Use a capacitor to smooth out fluctuations in the voltage.
The LCD is connected via I2C for displaying step count and voltage.
Usage
Once the hardware is set up and the code is uploaded to the Arduino, the system will:

Count footsteps detected by the piezoelectric sensors.
Display the step count and voltage generated on the LCD.
Store the energy in the battery and regulate it with the Arduino.
To Run the Project:
Connect the components as per the wiring instructions.
Upload the provided code to the Arduino via the Arduino IDE.
Walk on the footstep sensor area to generate energy.
Monitor the step count and voltage output on the LCD.
System Architecture
This system consists of the following major components:

Piezoelectric Sensors: Capture kinetic energy from footsteps.
Rectifier Circuit: Converts the alternating current (AC) from the piezoelectric sensors to direct current (DC).
Rechargeable Battery: Stores the generated energy for later use.
Arduino: Controls the system, monitors the battery, and displays the data.
LCD Display: Shows real-time data on step count and voltage.
Code Explanation
The code is written for Arduino and uses the LiquidCrystal_I2C library to display the results on an LCD screen. The following functionalities are implemented:

Footstep Detection: The code detects each step by monitoring changes in the output from the piezoelectric sensors.
Voltage Calculation: The voltage generated by the footstep pressure is calculated and displayed in real-time.
Step Counting: Each detected step increments a step count, which is also shown on the LCD.

    lcd.print(stepCount);
  } else {
    if (currentMillis - previousMillis >= 100) {
      previousMillis = currentMillis;
      digitalWrite(8, LOW);
    }
  }
  prev = v;
  lcd.setCursor(9, 1);
  vout = (v * 5.00) / 1024.00;
  vin = (vout / 0.040909) * 100;
  lcd.print(vin);
  lcd.print("mV ");
  delay(200);
}
Results
The project successfully demonstrated the concept of generating electricity from footsteps using piezoelectric sensors. Each step generates a small voltage, and the system efficiently stores the energy in a rechargeable battery. The step count and voltage are displayed on the LCD in real-time.

Observations:
The voltage output from individual sensors was small, but with multiple sensors, the system generated enough energy to power small devices.
The efficiency of the system increased with more foot traffic, showing the potential of this energy harvesting method in urban areas.
